# vhub-envs

Conda env and Jupyter kernel specifications exported from vhub.org and vhub.org/groups/ghub

These conda envs are found under the Debian10 anaconda-6 install in 
    vhub.org:/apps/share64/debian10/anaconda/anaconda-6/envs/

They are the kernels currently available from the Jupyter6Deb10 tool on vhub/ghub

Note that the kernel specs have been edited to include some PATH specifications

Some packages (e.g. geos) require system software that may not be available on the hub.
